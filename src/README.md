# Source Control
This directory should contain a single 'urls.txt' file which states the URLs of the Git repositories to clone into the Core for the cartridge. It is expected that these URLs will either be publicly available (i.e. no credentials required) or that Jenkins' SSH key has been added to allow cloning over SSH.
